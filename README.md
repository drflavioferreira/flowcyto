# flowcyto
This repository contains a set of R functions created to statistically treat and visualize flow cytometry. 
This work is part of a PhD project for the development of a high throughput bio-analytical methodology based on flow cytometry to monitor the health status of the bioprocessing CHO cells. 
The methodology uses unique recombinant lectins as probes to detect early changes in the glycoprofile of membrane proteins of CHO-K1 cells cultured under stressful conditions.
This R algorithm was created to automate the data analysis of a large flow cytometric dataset composed of around 300 million observations in which more than 15 different parameters were measured from each observation.
